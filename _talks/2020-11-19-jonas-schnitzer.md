title: Strong homotopy structure of Poisson reduction
speaker: Jonas Schnitzer
abstract: >
  Given a Hamiltonian symmetry on a Poisson manifold one can construct a Poisson
  structure on a reduced manifold. This can be achieved with the Poisson version
  of the Marsden-Weinstein reduction or equivalently with the BRST-method.

  Fixing a Lie group action on a manifold, one can define a curved Lie algebra
  whose Maurer-Cartan elements are Poisson structures together

  with momentum maps. Poisson structures on the reduced manifold are
  Maurer-Cartan elements of the usual DGLA of polyvector fields. Thus, reduction
  is just a map between these two sets of Maurer-Cartan elements.

  In my talk I want to show that this map is actually the map on Maurer-Cartan
  elements induced by an $L_infty$-morphism.
