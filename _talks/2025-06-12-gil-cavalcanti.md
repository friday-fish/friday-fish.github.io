title: Everything you wanted to know about gerbes but were afraid to ask
speaker: Gil Cavalcanti
abstract: >
  First, I will cover the material alluded to in the title. In the remaining two
  hours, I will define gerbes, try to give an idea of when they appear, talk
  about connections, loop spaces, Courant algebroids, vector bundle twists and
  topological T-duality. I will run out of time at some point in the middle.
