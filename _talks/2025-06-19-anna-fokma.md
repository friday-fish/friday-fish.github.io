title: Wrinkling and Haefliger structures
speaker: Anna Fokma
abstract: >
  Holonomic approximation is the main tool used in proving that the h-principle
  holds on open manifolds for a large class of partial differential relations.
  In the first part of this talk I discuss a generalization of holonomic
  approximation which also works on closed manifolds, using mild singularities
  known as wrinkles. In the second part, we use this result to carry out the
  first step of a strategy proposed by Laudenbach and Meigniez to study
  h-principles via a certain type of singular foliations known as Haefliger
  structures. We end with an application to the classifying space of principal
  groupoid bundles which encode Haefliger structures with a transverse geometry.
