title: On the causal discontinuity of Morse Spacetimes
speaker: Lucas Dahinden
abstract: >
  Morse spacetimes are Lorentz spacetimes with singularities where time behaves
  like a Morse function. The intention of the definition is that the spacetimes
  are "nice" but still allow the topology of "space" to change with time. Borde
  and Sorkin conjectured that such Morse spacetimes are causally continuous
  (a.k.a. nice) if and only if neither the index nor the coindex of any critical
  point is 1. This has been recently confirmed by Garc√≠a-Heveling for the case
  of small anisotropy and Euclidean background metric. Here, we provide a
  complementary counterexample: a four dimensional Morse spacetime whose
  critical point has index 2 and large enough anisotropy is causally
  discontinuous. Thus, the Borde-Sorkin conjecture does not hold. The proof
  features a low regularity causal structure and causal bubbling.
