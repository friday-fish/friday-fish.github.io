title: A glimpse of manifold calculus via embedding spaces
speaker: Yuqing Shi
abstract: >
  Manifold calculus is a useful theory which imports homotopy theoretical tools
  to analyse spaces of maps between manifolds. It provides us with a tower of
  fibrations, approximating the space of morphisms. In this talk, Iâ€™ll give an
  introduction of manifold calculus, via the example of embedding spaces of
  manifolds.
