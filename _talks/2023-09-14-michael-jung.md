title: Cohomotopy groups in co-degree one
speaker: Michael Jung
abstract: >
  It is a classical fact that for closed manifolds X the homotopy classes of
  maps X^n→S^n are classified by their degree. The Pontryagin-Thom construction
  provides a similar construction when X and the sphere have also different
  dimensions, and thus generalizes the notion of degree. In particular, the
  homotopy classes of maps X^n+1→S^n are in one-to-one correspondence with
  framed circles up to framed cobordism in X, and the corresponding set comes
  equipped with a group structure.

  In this talk, we introduce the Pontryagin-Thom construction and the concept of
  framed cobordism classes, and we compute the group of homotopy classes of maps
  X^n+1→S^n in terms of geometric and topological information of X. If time
  permits, we delve into some ideas of the proof, and discuss applications to
  vector bundles.
