title: 'Differentiable Stacks VI: Examples of Differentiable Stacks'
speaker: Bas Wensink
abstract: >
  In this talk, we will discuss a few increasingly more difficult examples of
  differentiable stacks, with the goal of seeing how the abstract theory pops up
  in concrete cases. One goal is to introduce the notion of orbifold in a way
  that fits nicely into the theory of differentiable stacks.
