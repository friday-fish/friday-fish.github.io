title: 'Symplectic : Contact = Poisson : Jacobi = Affine : Projective.'
speaker: Daniele Sepe
abstract: >
  While contact geometry is often described as the odd-dimensional analogue of
  symplectic geometry, Arnol'd pointed out that the relation between these two
  geometries is analogous to that between affine and projective geometries. A
  natural (vague!) question is to investigate the extent to which this analogy
  extends to the degenerate versions of symplectic and contact structures,
  namely Poisson and Jacobi geometries.

  The aim of this talk is to attempt to formalise the above question and to
  illustrate the intimate relation between these six geometries through a few
  specific problems, including isotropic realisations and Poisson/Jacobi
  manifolds of compact types. The talk is based on joint work with María Amelia
  Salazar, and on ongoing joint work with Camilo Angulo and María Amelia
  Salazar.
