title: Lie algebroids as curved Lie algebras
speaker: Joost Nuiten
abstract: >
  Differential graded Lie algebras play an important role in deformation theory
  as algebraic objects classifying the infinitesimal neighbourhoods of moduli
  spaces around a basepoint. An informal principle asserts that geometric
  objects without a fixed basepoint should admit a similar description in terms
  of curved Lie algebras, which have a `differential' whose square is controlled
  by a curvature element. In this talk, I will discuss the relation between two
  algebraic models for the formal neighbourhood of a moduli space around a
  manifold, rather than around a single point: in terms of dg-Lie algebroids and
  in terms of curved Lie algebras over the de Rham complex. In particular, I
  will describe an embedding of the homotopy category of dg-Lie algebroids into
  the homotopy category of such curved Lie algebras. Joint work with Damien
  Calaque and Ricardo Campos.
