title: A singular symplectic slice theorem
speaker: Anastasia Matveeva
abstract: >
  Motivated by semilocal normal forms and invariants for (non)-commutative
  integrable systems on manifolds with boundary, we prove a singular symplectic
  slice theorem for  $b^m$-symplectic manifolds and discuss some
  generalizations. This is joint work with Eva Miranda.
