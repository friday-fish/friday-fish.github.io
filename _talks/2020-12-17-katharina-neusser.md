title: Symmetry, Cartan connections and Rigidity
speaker: Katharina Neusser
abstract: >
  Many important geometric structures are geometrically rigid in the sense that
  their Lie algebra of infinitesimal automorphisms is finite-dimensional.
  Prominent examples of such structures are Riemannian and conformal manifolds,
  and in general all geometric structures admitting equivalent descriptions as
  so-called Cartan geometries. Generically these geometric structures have
  trivial automorphism groups and so the ones among them with large automorphism
  groups or special types of automorphisms are typically geometrically and
  topologically very constrained and hence can often be classified.

  In this talk I will discuss several such classification results and explain
  how Cartan connections can be used to study local and global questions of
  geometric rigidity. The talk will also provide an introduction to Cartan
  geometries with a focus on the subclass of parabolic geometries.
