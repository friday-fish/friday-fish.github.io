title: Globalizations of the Kontsevich Formality and their Homotopy Classes
speaker: Andreas Kraft
abstract: >
  The globalization procedure of the Kontsevich formality by Dolgushev depends
  on the choice of a torsion-free covariant derivative. We show that the
  globalized formalities with respect to two different covariant derivatives are
  homotopic. More explicitly, we derive the statement by proving a general
  homotopy equivalence between $L_infty$-morphisms that are twisted with gauge
  equivalent Maurer-Cartan elements. This talk is based on joint work with Jonas
  Schnitzer.
