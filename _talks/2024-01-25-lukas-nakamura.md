title: On pseudo-metrics on the space of Legendrian submanifolds
speaker: Lukas Nakamura
abstract: >
  In this talk, I give an overview over several results concerning certain
  pseudo-metrics on the space of Legendrian submanifolds of a contact manifold.
  After reviewing the necessary background, I give a proof of an upper bound on
  the distance between two loose Legendrians with respect to the
  Shelukhin-Chekanov-Hofer pseudo-metric and show that this pseudo-metric is not
  always non-degenerate. If time permits, I will also touch on relations between
  the existence of positive loops of Legendrians and properties of the
  pseudo-metrics on the space of Legendrians.
