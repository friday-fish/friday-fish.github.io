title: Poisson non-degeneracy of the Lie algebra so(3,1).
speaker: Florian Zeiser
abstract: >
  In this talk we take a look at the linearization question in Poisson geometry
  as first asked by Weinstein. We briefly recall what is

  currently known for semisimple Lie algebras. Moreover, we outline a proof for
  the Poisson non-degeneracy of the Lie algebra so(3,1). Therefore so(3,1) is
  the first example of a non-compact semisimple Lie algebra which is Poisson
  non-degenerate. This is based on joint work with Ioan Marcut.
