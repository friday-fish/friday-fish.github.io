title: Which symplectic forms on S2xS2 have Lagrangian Klein bottles?
speaker: Nikolas Adaloglou
abstract: |+
  Using (almost) toric fibrations and their visible Lagrangians we
  can construct many novel and interesting examples of Lagrangian
  submanifolds of symplectic 4 manifolds.  Naturally, one can ask whether
  visible Lagrangians are all the Lagrangians that exist, or, in other
  words, how faithful the pictures coming from almost toric fibrations are.
  I will answer this question for Klein bottles in  (S2xS2,omega_lambda),
  i.e.  the product of two spheres where the first factor has area 1 and the
  other factor has area lambda. In particular, I will first construct a
  visible Lagrangian Klein bottle when lambda<2.  Then I will show that no
  Lagrangian Klein bottles exist otherwise. The key input for obstructing
  the existence of the Klein bottles is Luttinger surgery along with
  techniques of  (compact) pseudoholomorpic curves and Seiberg-Witten
  theory.

  This is joint work with J. Evans.
