title: Singular chains on Lie groups and the Cartan relations
speaker: Camilo Arias Abad
abstract: >
  Let G be a simply connected Lie group. We denote by C(G) the differential
  graded Hopf algebra of smooth singular chains on G. We will

  explain how the category of modules over C(G) can be described infinitesimally
  in terms of representations of the differential graded Lie

  algebra Tg, which is universal for the Cartan relations. In case G is compact,
  this correspondence can be promoted to an A-infinity equivalence of
  differential graded categories. We will also explain how this equivalence is
  related to Chern-Weil theory and higher local systems on classifying spaces.

  This talk is based on joint work with Alexander Quintero VÃ©lez.
