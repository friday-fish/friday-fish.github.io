title: Some aspects of $C^0$-symplectic geometry
speaker: Dušan Joksimović
abstract: >
  A folklore theorem of Eliashberg and Gromov, which states that the group of
  symplectic diffeomorphisms is closed in the group of all diffeomorphisms
  w.r.t. C^0-topology, is considered the beginning of $C^0$-symplectic geometry
  which roughly investigates which symplectic phenomena persist under
  $C^0$-limits. It also allows us to define symplectic homeomorphisms (as
  $C^0-limits of symplectomorphisms) and $C^0$-symplectic manifolds. So far it
  is not known whether there are manifolds that admit a $C^0$-symplectic, but
  not smooth symplectic structures. One of the central question in the field,
  due to Hofer, is whether the spheres admit such structure in dimension greater
  than 2.

  In this (mostly overview) talk we will state and prove Elisahberg-Gromov's
  theorem using another result from $C^0$-symplectic geometry, namely, the
  $C^0$-rigidity of Poisson brackets due to Cardin-Viterbo, Entov-Polterovich,
  and Buhovski. If time allows, we will discuss Hofer's question as well.
