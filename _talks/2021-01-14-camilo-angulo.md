title: A cohomological proof for the integrability of strict Lie 2-algebras
speaker: Camilo Angulo
abstract: >
  A strict Lie 2-algebra is a groupoid object in the category of Lie algebras.
  These can naturally be seen as an infinitesimal version of strict Lie 2-groups
  which are groupoids in the category of Lie groups. Lie 2-algebras were proven
  to be integrable in this sense using the path strategy to integration, we
  present an alternative proof based on the van Est strategy.
