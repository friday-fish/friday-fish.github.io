title: Almost Toric Fibrations and Lagrangian Poincaré non-recurrence
speaker: Joel Schmitz
abstract: >
  Almost Toric Fibrations (ATFs) are a certain type of integrable system and
  provide a useful tool to study symplectic four-manifolds, allowing for various
  explicit constructions of Lagrangian torus knots and interesting
  symplectomorphisms. The latter gives a counterexample to the Lagrangian
  Poincaré recurrence conjecture. This talk will give a "users manual" to ATFs,
  outlining the tools used to manipulate them.
