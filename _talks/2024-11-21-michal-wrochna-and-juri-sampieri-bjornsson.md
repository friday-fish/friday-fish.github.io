title: b-geometry and asymptotic analysis
speaker: Michal Wrochna and Juri Sampieri Bjornsson
abstract: >
  Melrose's b-geometry provides a framework for dealing with problems of partial
  differential equations that arise in singular, degenerate or non compact
  geometric situations. This talk will give a brief outline, focusing
  particularly on the role of b-geometry in the asymptotic analysis of PDEs.

  In the first part, we will introduce the fundamentals of b-geometry, including
  the notions of b-metrics and b-vector bundles on manifolds with boundaries.

  The second part will shift to an analytical focus, exploring the asymptotic
  behavior of solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation on asymptotically de Sitter
  manifolds. We will introduce the essential analytical tools for this, such as
  b-differential operators and their normal operators, conormal and
  polyhomogeneous functions, and the Mellin transform.
