title: Real Forms of Holomorphic Hamiltonian Systems
speaker: Marine Fontaine
abstract: >
  By complexifying a Hamiltonian system one obtains dynamics on a holomorphic
  symplectic manifold. To invert this construction we present a theory of real
  forms which not only recovers the original system but also yields different
  real Hamiltonian systems which share the same complexification. In this talk I
  will explain the notion of real form for a symplectic manifold, more
  generally, for a Poisson manifold and will discuss their applications to
  integrable Hamiltonian systems. This is based on joint work with P. Arathoon.
