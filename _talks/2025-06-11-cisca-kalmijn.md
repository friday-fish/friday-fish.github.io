  Computing quantum cohomology of toric varieties using topological string
  theory
speaker: Cisca Kalmijn
abstract: >
  In this talk we will continue to explore the world of topological strings,
  specifically the A-twisted nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) as introduced by Jesse
  Straat on May 16th. The aim will be to actually compute the observables of a
  NLSM with a (smooth) toric variety as target. The trick will be to look at a
  so-called gauged linear sigma model (GLSM) whose low-energy limit is the NLSM
  we want. When studying the observables, we encounter the quantum cohomology
  ring, an extension of the ordinary cohomology, as a way of combining this
  information into a ring with product. It turns out that these observables are
  closely related to the Gromov–Witten invariants of classes corresponding to
  the operators we consider.

  If time permits, we will look at a different formulation of quantum cohomology
  using the Gromov–Witten invariants directly.

  Note that the talk will be accessible for both physicists and mathematicians
  that want to see such an approach to quantum cohomology.
