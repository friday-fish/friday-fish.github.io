title: Poisson manifolds of strong compact type over 2-tori
speaker: Luka Zwaan
abstract: >
  An integrable Poisson manifold is said to be of strong compact type if the
  source 1-connected groupoid integrating it is compact. One class of such
  manifolds is that of compact symplectic manifolds with finite fundamental
  group, but beyond that finding examples is difficult. The first non-symplectic
  example was given by D. Martínez Torres in 2014. The construction there is
  inspired by D. Kotschick’s construction of a free symplectic circle action
  with contractible orbits. In this talk I will go over the original
  construction, recalling the relevant results on Poisson manifolds of compact
  types as well as the geometry of the moduli spaces of K3 surfaces, and then
  modify the construction to obtain more examples. In the end, we will have for
  every strongly integral affine 2-torus (i.e. integral affine 2-torus with
  integral translational part) a Poisson manifold of strong compact type having
  that torus as its leaf space.
