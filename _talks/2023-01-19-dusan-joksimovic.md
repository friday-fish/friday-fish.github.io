title: C^0-rigidity of presymplectic embeddings
speaker: Dusan Joksimovic
abstract: >
  In this talk, we will show that the space of presymplectic embeddings of a
  closed presymplectic manifold (X, sigma) into a symplectic manifold (M,omega)
  (of the right dimension) is closed w.r.t the C^0 topology in the space of all
  embeddings of X into M.

  This result encodes several known forms of C^0 rigidity in symplectic geometry
  due to Eliashberg and Gromov (C^0-rigidity of symplectomorphisms), Laudenbach
  and Sikorav (C^0-rigidity of Lagrangian embeddings), and partially that of
  Humiliere, Leclercq, Seyfaddini (C^0-rigidity of coisotropic submanifolds).

  The talk is based on joint work in progress with K. Cieliebak and F. Ziltener.
