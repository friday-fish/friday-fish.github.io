title: Exploring the modular class of Dirac structures
speaker: Charlotte  Kirchhoff-Lukat
abstract: >
  The concept of modular class is best known for Poisson structures, but is
  naturally defined for any Lie algebroid: It is a class in the first Lie
  algebroid cohomology. Poisson structures as Lie algebroids have the special
  feature that their dual is isomorphic to the tangent bundle and thus
  representatives are vector fields, which allows for the definition of the
  so-called modular foliation, locally spanned by Hamiltonian vector fields and
  the modular vector field. This modular foliation can in turn be viewed as the
  foliation of a Poisson structure on the total space of the real line bundle
  det(T^*M) (Gualtieri-Pym).

  In this talk, I will show how to extend these concepts to general real or
  complex Dirac structures in exact Courant algebroids and discuss the
  information contained in the modular class of a Dirac structure in some
  non-Poisson examples.

  This is joint work in progress with Ralph Klaasse.
