title: Weighted normal bundles
speaker: Yiannis Loizides
abstract: >
  I will describe a variant of the normal bundle to a submanifold that is
  appropriate when one wants to treat normal directions to the submanifold as
  having different `weights'. The construction has applications to normal form
  theorems. This is joint work with Eckhard Meinrenken.
