  A symplectic approach to Gromov-Witten invariants part II: Semipositivity,
  (Gromov–Witten) pseudocycles and Gromov–Witten invariants
speaker: Cisca Kalmijn
abstract: >
  In part I we already set up some theory by looking at pseudoholomorphic curves
  and their moduli spaces; we also compactified the space of pseudoholomorphic
  maps using stable maps. Now we are interested in quotienting out the
  reparametrisation group, which gives us a new moduli space to study. We extend
  our notions of simple curves and regular almost complex structures to stable
  maps.

  We use these notions to impose the structure of a finite-dimensional manifold
  on the new moduli space, for which we must require that our target manifold is
  semipositive as well. Then we look at pseudocycles and their product
  structure, which allow us to define Gromov–Witten invariants. We conclude by
  considering some easy cases where we can actually calculate the invariants.
