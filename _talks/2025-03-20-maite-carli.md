  Differentiable Stakcs V: Equivalences of differentiable stacks from the Lie
  groupoid perspective; Morita equivalences and G-bibundles
speaker: Maite Carli
abstract: >
  Last week, we saw how Lie groupoids give rise to differentiable stacks and
  vice-versa. This talk answers the following question: How to detect an
  isomorphism between differentiable stacks from their corresponding Lie
  groupoids? This requires the introduction of Morita equivalences and
  G-bibundles. We show that Morita equivalent Lie groupoids correspond to
  isomorphic differentiable stacks. For this, we investigate what happens to
  morphisms of stacks under the above correspondence. If time remains, we give a
  criterion to detect Morita equivalent maps and explain their relation to
  G-bibundles.
