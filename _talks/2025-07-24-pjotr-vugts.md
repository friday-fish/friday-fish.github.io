title: 'The Khovanov homology: a knot invariant'
speaker: Pjotr Vugts
abstract: >
  In this talk we define and give an example of the Khovanov homology, an
  invariant of knots which is a categorification of the Jones polynomial.

  After a quick recap of some necessary knot theory, we will discuss the Jones
  polynomial. Then we move to the Khovanov bracket, a chain complex in the
  (additive closure of the Ab-enriched) category of cobordisms. Applying a TQFT
  to this Khovanov bracket gives us a chain complex of graded abelian groups,
  with graded Euler characteristic equal to the Jones polynomial. We show that
  the homology of this complex (this is the Khovanov homology) is a strictly
  stronger invariant than the Jones polynomial.
