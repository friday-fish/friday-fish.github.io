title: Recognition of objects and representability of symplectic capacities
speaker: Yann Guggisberg
abstract: >
  In this talk, I will define symplectic capacities, which are numerical
  invariants of symplectic manifolds. I will then present some examples, and
  provide some answers to questions asked by K. Cielibak, H. Hofer, J. Latschev,
  and F. Schlenk.

  First, I will show that for some symplectic categories, the generalized
  symplectic capacities recognize objects. This means that if all the capacities
  agree on two symplectic manifolds, then they are symplectomorphic. Hence, the
  generalized capacities on that category are a complete invariant.

  Next, I will give some concrete examples of capacities that cannot be
  represented by a target-embedding capacity.

  The talk is based on joint work with F. Ziltener.
