title: 'Differentiable Stacks III: Descent and Stacks'
speaker: Douwe Hoekstra
abstract: >
  At the end of the last talk, we saw that we can view categories fibered in
  groupoids as a lax presheaf with values in groupoids. A natural question then
  to ask is how and when we can glue objects and morphisms defined on some
  cover, similarly as one does with sheaves. This leads to the concept of
  descent data and stacks. We will also see that some examples from earlier
  talks turn out to be stacks.
