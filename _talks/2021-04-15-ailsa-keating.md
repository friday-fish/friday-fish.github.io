title: Two-variable singularities and symplectic topology
speaker: Ailsa Keating
abstract: >
  Start with a two-variable complex polynomial f with an isolated critical point
  at the origin. We will survey a range of classical structures associated to f,
  and explain how these can be revisited and enhanced using insights from
  symplectic topology. No prior knowledge of singularity theory will be assumed.
