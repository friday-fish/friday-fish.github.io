title: Vortex sheets in ideal fluids and coadjoint orbits
speaker: Cornelia Vizman
abstract: >
  We describe the coadjoint orbits of the group of volume preserving
  diffeomorphisms of R3 associated to the motion of closed vortex sheets in
  ideal 3D fluids. We show that these coadjoint orbits can be identified with
  nonlinear Grassmannians of compact surfaces enclosing a given volume and
  endowed with a closed 1-form describing the vorticity density. Goldin,
  Menikoff, and Sharp present in [1] the case of open vortex sheets
  (tubes/ribbons).

  If the vorticity density has a discrete period group and is nonvanishing, the
  vortex sheet is given by a surface of genus one fibered by its vortex lines
  over a circle. We determine the Hamilton equations for such vortex sheets
  relative to the Hamiltonian function suggested by Khesin in [2] and we prove
  that there are no stationary solutions having rotational symmetries. These
  coadjoint orbits are shown to be prequantizable if the period group of the
  1-form and the volume enclosed by the surface satisfy an Onsager-Feynman
  relation.
