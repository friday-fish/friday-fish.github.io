title: Topology, symplectic topology, … what’s next?
speaker: Oliver Fabert
affiliation: VU
abstract: >
  In topology one uses Morse theory to prove lower bounds
  for the number of 0-dimensional objects, namely critical points of
  smooth functions on smooth manifolds. In symplectic topology one
  uses Floer theory to prove lower bounds for the number of
  1-dimensional objects, namely solutions to Hamiltonian ODEs. In this
  talk I will outline how the framework of symplectic topology can be
  generalized to study 2-dimensional or even higher-dimensional
  objects, leading to a class of first-order (Hamiltonian) PDEs
  sharing similar rigidity properties. In the same way as the
  Hamiltonian ODEs provide a generalized framework for classical
  mechanics, our class of Hamiltonian PDEs shall provide a generalized
  framework for studying equilibrium states of reaction-diffusion
  systems. This is joint work with my PhD student Ronen Brilleslijper.
