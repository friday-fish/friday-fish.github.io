title: b-Contact Structures on Tentacular Hyperboloids
speaker: Jagna WiÅ›niewska
abstract: >
  In recent years there have been independently developed a variety of
  techniques to deal with the issue of non-compactness of a contact manifold.
  One is the definition of a class of Hamiltonians called tentacular
  Hamiltonians and the extension of Rabinowitz Floor homology to the non-compact
  zero level sets thereof. Another is the extension of contact structures to
  manifolds with singularities called b-contact structures. That rises obvious
  questions: are any of those techniques related?

  In this talk I show that this question can be answered affirmatively and
  present a class of hyperboloids called tentacular hyperboloids for which those
  two techniques can be applied alternatively.
