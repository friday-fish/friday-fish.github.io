title: sc-geometry and scattering Dirac operator
speaker: Ashkan Kyaee
abstract: >
  This lecture will follow last week's talk about b-geometry by introducing the
  framework of sc-geometry. Motivated by the analysis of operators on manifolds
  with boundaries, we will define sc-metrics (or asymptotically conic),
  sc-vector bundles and sc-connections.

  As an example, we are going to look into the construction of the scattering
  Dirac operator on scattering Clifford modules, which is an elliptic
  differential operator of interest in index theory on asymptotically conic
  manifolds.
