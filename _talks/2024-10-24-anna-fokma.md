title: 'Jiggling: an h-principle without homotopical assumptions'
speaker: Anna Fokma
abstract: >
  In 1974 Thurston, in one of his many proofs on foliations, used a technique
  called jiggling. This shows that, given a distribution, any embedding is
  homotopic to a piecewise transverse embedding. I will discuss the key ideas in
  the proof of jiggling and how we can generalize jiggling to certain first
  order differential relations on bundles. This allows us to make statements
  about the topology of the space of (piecewise) solutions of such a relation. I
  will give examples as to how these statements compare to other so-called
  h-principles.
