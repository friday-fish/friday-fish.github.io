title: A DGA Invariant for Legendrian Knots
speaker: Wei Zhou
abstract: >
  In contact geometry, Legendrian submanifolds are fundamental objects, though
  their classification remained poorly understood until the 1990s. In this talk,
  we will review some classical invariants and introduce the Chekanov-Eliashberg
  DGA invariant in R^3, whose ideas stem from the framework of pseudoholomorphic
  curves.

  Note that this talk will take place at the VU, NU9A46
