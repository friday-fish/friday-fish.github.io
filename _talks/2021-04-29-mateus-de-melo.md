title: Proper groupoids and Riemannian geometry
speaker: Mateus de Melo
abstract: >
  In this talk, we will explore relationships between Riemannian geometry and
  Lie groupoids. We will begin by reviewing the correspondence between effective
  proper isometric actions and closed subgroups of the isometry group, then we
  will see how to translate it to Lie groupoids. Next, we discuss the linear
  holonomy groupoid for singular Riemannian foliations and show that its closure
  is a proper Lie groupoid. We finish by giving results about how far a
  Riemannian groupoid is from being proper. This talk is based on joint work
  with Marcos Alexandrino, Marcelo Inagaki, and Ivan Struchiner.
