abstract: >
  Locally conformally symplectic manifolds appear very
  naturally when studying contact manifolds. They are a slight
  generalization of symplectic manifolds that exist under mild
  topologic condition. Like in symplectic and contact topology,
  interesting non-squeezing phenomena occurs some of which will be
  described in the talk. It is joint work with Pranav Chakravarthy and
  Margherita Sandon.
