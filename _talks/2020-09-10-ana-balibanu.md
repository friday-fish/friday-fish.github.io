title: Universal centralizers and Poisson transversals
speaker: Ana Balibanu
abstract: >
  Let G be a semisimple complex algebraic group of adjoint type. We consider a
  multiplicative analogue of the universal centralizer of G --- a family of
  centralizers parametrized by the regular conjugacy classes of the
  simply-connected cover of G. This multiplicative analogue has a natural
  symplectic structure and sits as a transversal in a variation of the
  quasi-Poisson double D(G). We show that D(G) extends to a smooth groupoid over
  the wonderful compactification of G, and we use this to construct a partial
  compactification of the multiplicative universal centralizer.
