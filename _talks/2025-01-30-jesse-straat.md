  An Algebro-Geometric Approach to Gromov–Witten Invariants, part II: Virtual
  Fundamental Classes and Gromov–Witten Invariants
speaker: Jesse Straat
abstract: >
  We pick up from the previous talk to define Gromov–Witten invariants. First,
  we provide a short introduction of Chow groups, the algebraic cousin of
  (co-)homology, in the case of algebraic varieties. Using the definition of
  Deligne–Mumford stacks from the previous talk, we construct the Kontsevich
  (moduli) stack of stable maps on projective algebraic varieties over ℂ using
  nodal curves. We discuss the virtual fundamental class (without proof) in the
  Chow group and push it forward along an evaluation map to define Gromov–Witten
  invariants. These will be rational numbers that, in nice cases, correspond to
  the number of stable maps that satisfy some property. Finally, we will look at
  the situation of projective space and explicitly calculate the Gromov–Witten
  invariants.
