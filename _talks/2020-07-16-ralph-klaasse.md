title: Symplectic groupoids of elliptic Poisson manifolds
speaker: Ralph Klaasse
abstract: >
  In this talk we describe an ongoing project to construct the adjoint
  (symplectic) groupoids associated to elliptic Poisson structures. These are a
  type of Poisson structure that is nondegenerate outside of a submanifold of
  codimension two. We will describe the geometry of these structures and see
  that their behavior depends on their so-called elliptic residue, and
  consequently so do the groupoids. Tools that are used in our constructions are
  the blow-up procedure for groupoids of Gualtieri-Li, a normal form result due
  to Witte, and the fact that elliptic Poisson manifolds can be blown-up to be
  log-Poisson, as noticed by Cavalcanti-Gualtieri.
