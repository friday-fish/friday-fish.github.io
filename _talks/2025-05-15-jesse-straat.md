title: A geometric introduction to topological string theory and  mirror symmetry
speaker: Jesse Straat
abstract: >
  The goal of this talk is to introduce the concept of mirror symmetry. Mirror
  symmetry is a relation between Calabi–Yau threefolds that allows one to
  identify type IIA string theory on one Calabi–Yau threefold with type IIB on
  the other (known as its mirror manifold). To a mathematician, this makes it
  possible to calculate Gromov–Witten invariants by considering type IIB
  correlators, which are typically much easier to compute. We start off by
  constructing the A-twisted and B-twisted nonlinear sigma model QFT, and
  discussing what exactly makes these models nice, by identifying their BRST
  cohomology with cohomology on spacetime. We introduce the definition of mirror
  symmetry and its geometric implications, explicitly constructing a mirror
  manifold of the famous quintic threefold. If time permits, we will promote the
  twisted nonlinear sigma model to the types IIA and IIB string theory and
  explicitly showcase the emergence of Gromov–Witten invariants in type IIA
  string theory.
    This talk will be accessible for both physicists and mathematicians who are interested in the geometric construction of topological string theories and mirror symmetry. For the mathematicians, it will be beneficial, but not necessary, to have a conceptual understanding of quantum field theory.
