title: Haefliger's differentiable cohomology
speaker: Luca Accornero
abstract: >
  The differentiable cohomology of a pseudogroup on a manifold M was defined by
  André Haefliger in the seventies, in the development of characteristic classes
  of foliations. In Haefliger's approach to the subject, foliations are seen as
  cocycles valued in the étale groupoid Gamma^q of germs of diffeomorphisms of
  R^q. From this point of view, the theory of characteristic classes for
  foliations is reminiscent of the theory of characteristic classes for flat
  principal g-bundles, which can be represented as cocycles valued in the
  discrete group G^delta. 

  For such bundles, a "geometric" characteristic map is defined. It is a map
  from the relative cohomology H*(g, K) of the Lie algebra g of G to the
  cohomology of M. The classical Van-Est isomorphism for Lie groups allows one
  to interpret it as a map from the differentiable cohomology H_d*(G) of G to
  H*(M). A similar "geometric" map is available for foliations and is defined
  from the cohomology GF^q of the Gelfand-Fuchs Lie algebra of formal vector
  fields on R^q relative to O(q). Haefliger defined a differentiable complex for
  the groupoid Gamma^q and proved a Van Est isomorphism between the
  differentiable cohomology H*_{diff}(Gamma^q) and the cohomology of the
  relative Gelfand-Fuchs Lie algebra, making the analogy with flat principal
  bundles complete. 

  His construction focuses on the groupoid Gamma^q and, probably also because of
  the seemingly ad-hoc approach, did not receive much attention. Furthermore, it
  is not clear which is the structure that makes the definition work. Our main
  driving question is to find such a structure. The outcome is the structure of
  "flat Cartan groupoid" on the infinite jet groupoid J^inftyGamma^q, which is
  well known for the role that plays in the geometric theory of PDE. After
  reviewing Haefliger's approach and introducing flat Cartan groupoids, we will
  define their "Haefliger cohomology",  investigate its infinitesimal
  counterpart and relate the two by a Van Est map. Finally, we will construct a
  characteristic map for cocycles valued in a flat Cartan groupoid, which
  reduces to the "geometric" map for foliations when the groupoid is
  J^inftyGamma^q.

  This is joint work with Marius Crainic.
