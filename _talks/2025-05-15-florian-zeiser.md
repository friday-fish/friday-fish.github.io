title: (Infinitesimal) Rigidity for foliations and group actions
speaker: Florian Zeiser
abstract: >
  A common question for geometric structures is that of rigidity, i.e. given two
  geometric structures sufficiently close, are they equivalent? In this talk we
  discuss this question for regular foliations on a closed manifold.

  In the first part we give an overview of the current state of the art and
  highlight its relation with the rigidity for group actions. We will see that
  several rigidity results for foliations require the leaves to be compact. 

  In an attempt to understand whether such results can be extended to Riemannian
  foliations, we seek examples of such foliations which are infinitesimally
  rigid with non-compact leaves. In the second part, we use the relation to
  group actions to construct infinitesimally rigid Lie foliation with
  non-compact, dense leaves. This is based on joint work in progress with
  Stephane Geudens.
