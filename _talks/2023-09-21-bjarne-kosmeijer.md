title: Lie-Rinehart algebras and non-commutative geometry
speaker: Bjarne Kosmeijer
abstract: >
  In this talk we will introduce Lie-Rinehart algebras, the algebraic
  counterpart to Lie algebroids, and discuss elements of their non-commutative
  geometry, as to work towards the statement "The Hochschild cohomology of the
  universal enveloping algebra of a Lie-Rinehart algebra is isomorphic to the
  cohomology associated to the symmetric powers of the adjoint".

  The first part of the talk will be used to define Lie-Rinehart algebras and
  associated concepts. In the second part we will discuss the mentioned theorem,
  following a preprint in final preparation joint with Hessel Posthuma.
