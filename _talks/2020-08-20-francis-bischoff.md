title: Lie groupoids and logarithmic connections
speaker: Francis Bischoff
abstract: >
  In this talk I'll describe a Lie groupoid based approach to the study of flat
  connections with logarithmic singularities on a hypersurface.

  Flat connections on the affine line with logarithmic singularity at the origin
  are equivalent to representations of a groupoid associated to the
  exponentiated action of C. I'll describe a canonical Jordan-Chevalley
  decomposition for these representations, and show how this leads to a
  functorial classification.

  Flat connections on a general complex manifold with logarithmic singularities
  along a hypersurface are equivalent to representations of a twisted
  fundamental groupoid. By using a Morita equivalence, the category of
  logarithmic flat connections can be localized to the normal bundle of the
  hypersurface. I'll explain how this can be used to prove a functorial
  Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for logarithmic flat connections.
