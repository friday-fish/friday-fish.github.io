title: 'Differentiable Stacks IV: Differentiable Stacks'
speaker: Sven Holtrop
abstract: >
  Two weeks ago, we were introduced to the notion of a stack on the category of
  manifolds. However, not all these stacks lend themselves well to doing
  geometry. In this talk, we will focus on class of stacks for which one can do
  geometry, namely the differentiable stacks. These are stacks, which can be
  covered by smooth manifolds in a consistent manner. After understanding all
  the definitions, we will discuss examples and non-examples of differentiable
  stacks. In addition, we will begin with relating the geometry of the covers to
  the geometry of the underlying stacks.
