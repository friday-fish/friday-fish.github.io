  On the homotopy type of the contactomorphism group of a tight contact
  3-manifold
speaker: Eduardo Fernandez
abstract: >
  One of the building blocks in the study of the homotopy type of the
  diffeomorphism group of a 3-manifold is the positive answer of A. Hatcher to
  the Smale conjecture. This result has its contact counterpart: Eliashberg's
  theorem about the contractibility of the contactomorphism group of the tight
  contact 3–ball.

  In order to adapt the smooth techniques to the contact world, it is necessary
  to develop an understanding of the space of embeddings of surfaces into a
  given tight contact 3-manifold. In this talk we will see how to do this for
  simple surfaces such as disks and spheres. As a consequence, we will conclude
  that, with the exception of connected components, all the remaining homotopy
  groups of the group of contactomorphisms of a tight contact 3-manifold are
  controlled by topological invariants.

  This talk is a continuation of the previous talk "Flexibility in contact
  3-manifolds: from contactomorphisms to legendrian knots" by Javier
  Martínez-Aguinaga. Joint work with Javier Martínez-Aguinaga and Fran Presas.
