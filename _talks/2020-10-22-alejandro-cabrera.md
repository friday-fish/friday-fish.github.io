title: On singular cotangent homotopies coming from the Poisson Sigma Model
speaker: Alejandro Cabrera
abstract: >
  In this talk, the idea is to describe with some detail certain singular
  cotangent (algebroid) homotopies, associated to a Poisson manifold M, which
  appear as a semiclassical limit in the Poisson Sigma Model (PSM). To that end,
  first, we will review the heuristic motivation for the PDEs that define these
  homotopies and their role in quantization. We then proceed to describe the
  solutions and relate them to certain triangles in an integrating groupoid. The
  final aim is to show how these homotopies, when fed into a PSM action
  functional, yield a generating function for the structure of a (local)
  symplectic groupoid integrating the underlying Poisson M.
