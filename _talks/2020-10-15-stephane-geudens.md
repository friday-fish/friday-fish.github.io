title: Deformations of Lagrangian submanifolds in log-symplectic manifolds
speaker: Stephane Geudens
abstract: >
  Log-symplectic structures are a type of Poisson structures that are symplectic
  outside of a hypersurface. The aim of this talk is to discuss whether the
  deformation theory of Lagrangian submanifolds in this setting is as
  well-behaved as in symplectic geometry.

  We will focus on deformations of a Lagrangian submanifold contained in the
  singular locus of a log-symplectic manifold. Using a normal form around the
  Lagrangian, we show that the deformation problem is governed by a DGLA. We
  discuss whether the Lagrangian admits deformations not contained in the
  singular locus, and we give criteria for unobstructedness. If time permits, we
  also address equivalences of Lagrangian deformations under Hamiltonian and
  Poisson isotopies.

  This is joint work with Marco Zambon.
