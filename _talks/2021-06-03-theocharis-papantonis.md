title: >-
  On representations up to homotopy of Lie n-algebroids and higher VB-algebroid
  structures
speaker: Theocharis Papantonis
abstract: >
  In this talk, we will discuss the representation theory of higher Lie
  algebroids and higher VB-algebroid structures on double vector bundles. We
  will give the basic definitions about representations (up to homotopy) of Lie
  n-algebroids and construct some basic examples, such as the adjoint and
  coadjoint representations. Next, we will define the notion of a VB-Lie
  n-algebroid and explain how they correspond to (n+1)-representations of their
  side Lie n-algebroid, generalizing thus a well-known result from
  representation theory of ordinary Lie algebroids.

  The talk is based on a joint work with Madeleine Jotz Lean and Rajan Mehta.
