title: 'Characteristic classes for Lie groupoids: going to the basics'
speaker: MarÃ­a Amelia Salazar
abstract: >
  Characteristic classes are an important tool in algebra, geometry and topology
  as they encode invariants that can often be calculated explicitly. In this
  talk I will present some recent ongoing work about the definition of
  characteristic classes associated to representations of Lie groupoids. I will
  concentrate on the construction of such classes as this will shine some light
  on the underlying geometry and the relation with the classifying space.
