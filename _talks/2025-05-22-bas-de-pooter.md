  Coarse minimality for non-convex star-shaped contact surfaces in the cotangent
  bundle
speaker: Bas de Pooter
abstract: >
  Minimal geodesic flows on closed hyperbolic manifolds (manifolds which support
  a negative curvature metric) exhibit a strong rigidity: their flows are
  topologically conjugate. Slightly more generally, for any geodesic flow on a
  hyperbolic manifold, it has a non-empty set of globally minimal geodesics,
  which always shadow geodesics of a given negative curvature metric.

  For Reeb flows on star-shaped contact surfaces, it is impossible to be minimal
  when the surface is strictly not convex fiberwise. However, for a slight
  generalization of minimality, called coarse minimality, we can produce
  examples of non-convex hypersurfaces with coarsely minimal Reeb flows.
  Additionally, there is a semi-conjugacy coarsely minimal flows and the
  geodesic flow a given negative curvature metric.
