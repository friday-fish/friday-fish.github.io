title: Stacky Lie algebroids
speaker: Miquel Cueca Ten
abstract: >
  Differentiable stacks are useful models for singular spaces. Fifteen years
  ago, Tseng and Zhu defined stacky Lie groupoids and used them to study the
  integrability of Lie algebroids. In this talk we will introduce their
  infinitesimal counterpart, stacky Lie algebroids, and we shall give their
  basic properties.

  If time permits, we will comment on the integrability of Courant algebroids.
  This is a joint work with Daniel Alvarez.
