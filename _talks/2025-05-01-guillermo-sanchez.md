title: h-principles for Holomorphic Partial Differential Relations in Stein Manifolds
speaker: Guillermo Sánchez
abstract: >
  The goal of the h-principle theory is to understand when a geometric problem
  is governed by the laws of differential topology. When topology (more
  flexible) overrides geometry (more rigid), we say that the h-principle holds
  in that context.

  The identity principle and the resulting lack of partitions of unity endow
  complex geometry with great rigidity. However, there is a class of complex
  manifolds—Stein manifolds—in which the Oka principle, a type of h-principle
  for holomorphic functions, holds. The flexible properties of Stein manifolds
  have been exploited by F. Forstnerič and M. Slapar to establish h-principles
  for holomorphic immersions and submersions, and by F. Forstnerič for complex
  contact forms. In this talk, we will explore how these techniques can be
  abstracted to obtain more general h-principles in this type of complex
  manifolds.
