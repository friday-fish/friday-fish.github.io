title: 'Differentiable Stacks I: Stack of Triangles'
speaker: Bas Wensink
abstract: >
  In this first talk on differentiable stack, we will return to a mathematical
  object from high school mathematics: the triangle. Classifying triangles and
  continuous families of triangles moves us into the world of stacks, and will
  provide us with the first example of a stack. This gives us a concrete example
  in which we can see the concepts that will later play a role in the discussion
  of general differentiable stacks.
