title: The Atiyah class and ideal systems
speaker: Madeleine Jotz Lean
abstract: >
  This talk describes the Atiyah class of a holomorphic vector bundle and
  explains how it can be understood as the Atiyah class of an infinitesimal
  ideal system. Then it explains how Molino's Atiyah class also fits in this
  context.

  The Atiyah class of a Lie pair is an obstruction to the existence of an ideal
  system (Ã  la Mackenzie and Higgins) on the Lie pair.
