abstract: >
  In this fourth lecture on the Seiberg–Witten invariants we will finally introduce the Seiberg–Witten equations and set up
  the basic framework we will need to study the moduli space of its solutions. We will start by studying basic properties of spinor
  bundles and Dirac operators. Then we will introduce the equations and their gauge symmetries, and explain how they can be
  extended to Sobolev spaces so that weak solutions are allowed. If time permits, we will briefly sketch how the Seiberg–Witten
  equations can be regarded as the smallest topologically allowed minima of the Seiberg–Witten action functional.
