title: T-duality for transitive Courant algebroids
speaker: Liana David
abstract: >
  I will begin with a brief account on the theory of generalized connections and
  Dirac generating operators on transitive Courant algebroids. I will develop a
  T-duality for transitive Courant algebroids, which is a generalization of the
  T-duality of Cavalcanti and Gualtieri in the exact case. I will show that
  T-duality between transitive Courant agebroids E ra M and tilde{E} ra tilde{M}
  induces a map between the spaces of sections of the corresponding canonical
  weighted spinor bundles of E and tilde{E} which intertwines the canonical
  Dirac generating operators.  I will present a general existence result for
  T-duals under assumptions generalizing the cohomology integrality conditions
  for  the T-duality in the exact case.

  If time allows, I will explain that the T-dual of a heterotic Courant
  algebroid is again heterotic.  This is joint work with Vicente Cortes.
