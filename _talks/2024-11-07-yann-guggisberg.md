  Instantaneous Hamiltonian diplaceability and arbitrary squeezability for
  critically negligible sets
speaker: Yann Guggisberg
abstract: >
  This talk will be about joint work with Fabian Ziltener in which we show that
  a compact n-rectifiable subset of R^{2n} with vanishing n-Hausdorff measure
  can be displaced from itself by a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism arbitrarily close
  to the identity. This has the consequence that such a set can be arbitrarily
  symplectically squeezed, i.e. embedded into any neighborhood of the origin in
  R^{2n}.
