title: Hyperk채hler realizations of holomorphic Poisson surfaces
speaker: Maxence Mayrand
abstract: >
  I will discuss the existence of hyperk채hler structures on symplectic
  realizations of holomorphic Poisson manifolds, and show that they always exist
  when the Poisson manifold has complex dimension two. We obtain this structure
  by constructing a twistor space by lifting special deformations of the Poisson
  surface adapted from Hitchin's unobstructedness theorem. In the case of the
  zero Poisson structure, we recover the Feix-Kaledin hyperk채hler structure on
  the cotangent bundle of a K채hler manifold. This talk is based on
  arXiv:2011.09282.
