title: The deformation cohomology of a symplectic groupoid
speaker: João Nuno Mestre
abstract: >
  Symplectic groupoids are Lie groupoids equipped with multiplicative symplectic
  forms, and serve as global counterparts to (integrable) Poisson manifolds, in
  the same way that Lie groups are global counterparts to Lie algebras.

  In this talk I will present the construction of the deformation cohomology
  controlling deformations of symplectic groupoids, built out of the deformation
  complexes of a Lie groupoid and of a multiplicative form. We will see that it
  can be identified with the total complex of a sub double complex of the
  Bott-Shulman-Stasheff double complex.

  I will then compute this cohomology in some particular cases (linear Poisson
  structures and proper groupoids), explain how to use it in a Moser path
  argument, and describe some relations to the deformation theory of the
  corresponding Poisson manifolds.

  This is joint work with Cristian Cárdenas (UFF) and Ivan Struchiner (USP).
