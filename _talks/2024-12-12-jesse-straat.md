  An Algebro-Geometric Approach to Gromov--Witten Invariants, part I: In Pursuit
  of Stacks
speaker: Jesse Straat
abstract: >
  In this first part of a journey of constructing Gromov–Witten invariants, we
  set the stage by defining the necessary concepts used in the construction. We
  start by discussing the shortcomings of the classical concept of moduli spaces
  — in particular the absence of a fundamental class — and sketch how this
  provides an obstruction to defining Gromov–Witten invariants. It turns out
  that there is a concept of virtual fundamental classes on generalisations of
  spaces called Deligne–Mumford stacks. We define stacks in the context of
  complex geometry without relying too much on categorical concepts such as
  limits. Given enough time, we will discuss how stacks are applied in moduli
  problems and use vector bundles as an example. In the next part, the developed
  theory will be used to discuss the moduli problem of stable maps and define
  Gromov–Witten invariants.
