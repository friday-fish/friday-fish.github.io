title: 'Differentiable Stacks II: A Categorical Prologue'
speaker: Jaime Pedregal Pastor
abstract: >
  This second talk will be the necessary categorical prologue to stalks. We will
  first introduce a generalization of a topology to arbitrary categories, which
  will allow us to talk about sheaves on a category. We will then spend some
  time studying fibered categories, which are the basis for the first definition
  of a stack. Finally, we will introduce the basics of (strict) 2-categories as
  a prerequisite for the second definition of a stack. Examples will be
  sprinkled throughout the talk.
