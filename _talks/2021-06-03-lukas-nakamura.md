title: Small energy isotopies of loose Legendrian submanifolds
speaker: Lukas Nakamura
abstract: >
  On the one hand, loose Legendrian submanifolds of contact manifolds are
  topologically flexible according to Murphy's h-principle. On the other hand,
  Legendrians are often times rigid with respect to the energy of
  contactomorphisms. For example, Dimitroglou Rizell and Sullivan showed that
  the displacement energy of closed Legendrians in certain contact manifolds is
  bounded away from zero. In this talk, I will explain that loose Legendrians
  with nice loose charts are as flexible as they can be according to Dimitroglou
  Rizell and Sullivan's rigidity result. The result can be interpreted as a
  quantitative version of Murphy's h-principle.
