title: Abelianisation of Meromorphic GL(2,C)-Connections on Riemann Surfaces
speaker: Nikita Nikolaev
abstract: >
  Meromorphic connections on Riemann surfaces (i.e., an invariant point of view
  on complex singular ODEs) can be understood as representations of relevant
  holomorphic Lie algebroids or equivalently (by integration, called the
  Riemann-Hilbert correspondence) as Lie groupoid representations. I will
  describe an approach to studying these objects called abelianisation. It uses
  simple combinatorial data attached to the Riemann surface (certain topological
  graphs) to recast the representations into the nonabelian group GL(n,C)
  instead as the rather more amicable representations into the abelian group C*
  but on a suitable n-fold covering Riemann surface. This technique has its
  origins in the works of Fock-Goncharov (2006) and Gaiotto-Moore-Neitzke
  (2013), as well as the WKB analysis. I will explain this correspondence in the
  case n=2 as an equivalence of categories of representations.

  This presentation is based on arXiv:1902.03384 and the more recent work in
  progress extending those results.
