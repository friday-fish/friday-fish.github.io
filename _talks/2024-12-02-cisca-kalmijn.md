  A symplectic approach to Gromov--Witten invariants, part I: Pseudoholomorphic
  curves and their moduli spaces
speaker: Cisca Kalmijn
abstract: >
  In this talk we work towards a symplectic approach to Gromov--Witten
  invariants, which we do by investigating pseudoholomorphic curves. Examining
  the relevant moduli space, we find it is a manifold under suitable
  assumptions. We ensure compactness by extending the moduli space of
  pseudoholomorphic curves to the moduli space of stable maps, which incorporate
  the limiting behaviour of “bubbling”. If time permits, we look at these stable
  maps to find a notion of convergence, Gromov convergence, that gives us
  compactness for the moduli space used in the definition of Gromov--Witten
  invariants.

  In part II we  use these moduli spaces to define the Gromov--Witten
  invariants.
