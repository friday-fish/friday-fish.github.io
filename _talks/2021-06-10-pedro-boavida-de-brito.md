title: Scanning embeddings by points
speaker: Pedro Boavida de Brito
abstract: >
  I will survey some old ideas and some recent developments in the study of
  spaces of smooth embeddings, starting from the early work of Haefliger, and
  leading on to the embedding calculus of Goodwillie-Weiss.

  In the second part, I will focus on the case of classical knots and discuss
  some questions and recent progress on relating the homotopical approach to
  finite type theory.
