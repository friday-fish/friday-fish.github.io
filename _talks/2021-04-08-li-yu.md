title: Wonderful Compactification of a Cartan Subalgebra of a Semisimple Lie Algebra
speaker: Li Yu
abstract: >
  Let $H$ be a Cartan subgroup of a semisimple algebraic group $G$ over the
  complex numbers.  The wonderful compactification $bar H$ of $H$ was introduced
  and studied by De Concini and Procesi.  For the Lie algebra $fh$ of $H$, we
  define an analogous compactification $bar fh$ of $fh$, to be referred to as
  the wonderful compactification of $fh$.  We establish a bijection between the
  set of irreducible components of the boundary $bar fh - fh$ of $fh$ and the
  set of maximal closed root subsystems of the root system for $(G, H)$ of rank
  $r - 1$, where $r$ is the dimension of $fh$.  An algorithm based on Borel-de
  Siebenthal theory that constructs all such root subsystems is given.  We prove
  that each irreducible component of $bar fh - fh$ is isomorphic to the
  wonderful compactification of a Lie subalgebra of $fh$ and is of dimension $r
  - 1$.  In particular, the boundary $bar fh - fh$ is equidimensional.  We

  describe a large subset of the regular locus of $bar fh$.  As a consequence,
  we prove that $bar fh$ is a normal variety.
