title: The singular Weinstein conjecture
speaker: CÃ©dric Oms
abstract: >
  In this talk, we study contact structures that admit certain types of
  singularities, called $b^m$-contact structures. Those structures can be viewed
  as a particular case of Jacobi manifolds satisfying some transversality
  conditions. The motivation to study this generalization of contact structures
  arises from classical examples in celestial mechanics, as for example the
  restricted planar circular three body problem (RPC3BP), but also appears in
  the study of fluid dynamics on manifolds with cylindrical ends.

  We will focus on understanding the dynamics of the associated Reeb vector
  field of $b^m$-contact forms. Due to singularities, the dynamics are
  fundamentally different to smooth Reeb dynamics and we will discuss a singular
  version of Weinstein conjecture on the existence of periodic orbits on those
  manifolds. Time permitting, we talk about generic existence of so called
  singular periodic orbits.

  This is joint work with Eva Miranda and work in progress with Eva Miranda and
  Daniel Peralta-Salas.
