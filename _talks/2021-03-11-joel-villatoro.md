title: Integrating singular foliations with paths
speaker: Joel Villatoro
abstract: >
  In this talk I will talk about a joint work with Alfonso Garmendia. Singular
  foliations are a class of subsheaves of the sheaf of vector fields. Although
  they are not Lie algebroids, singular foliations are sheaves of Lie-Rinehart
  algebras and therefore have many features in common with Lie algebroids. In
  this talk I will discuss how to generalize the path model for integrating Lie
  algebroids to the setting of singular foliations.
